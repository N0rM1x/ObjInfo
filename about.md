# ObjInfo

At first place, this mod was made for creators, who wants more info about their level`s optimisation, by seeing how much objects it renders while playing.

The second thing is total level`s object counter, it's useless if you could copy the level, but sometimes could come in handy.

You could edit overlay opacity or choose parameters to show in mod`s settings.

That was my first mod, so I hope it wouldn't be so awful.

BTW, if you have some ideas on what I could add to this mod, I`m open to suggestions in my Discord!
