# ObjInfo

At first place, this mod was made for creators, who wants more info about their level`s optimisation, by seeing how much stuff the game renders each frame.

Mod gives you info about some stuff, like:
- Total level`s object counter, it's useless if you could copy the level, but sometimes could come in handy.
- Total level`s trigger counter, it's pretty useful, bc KEEP IN MIND, triggers need more resources than regular, static objects or single particles
- Active particles counter, it's SUPER USEFUL because sometimes creators forgetting, that every single particle are pretty close to regular object`s render requirements 

You could edit overlay opacity or parameters offset and size in mod`s settings.

That was my first mod, so I hope it wouldn't be so awful.

BTW, if you have some ideas on what I could add to this mod, or you found some bugs, I`m open to suggestions and reports in my Discord and GitHub!
